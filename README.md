Detect gravitational waves in spectrograms using a Deep Fully Convolutional Net (DFCN), which basically allows arbitrary input sizes.



### To Do List:

* Fuzzy Labels / Loss Function
* Curriculum Learning â†’ How faint can we go?
* Parameter Estimation: Chirp Mass, Distance
* Use real noise â†’ Instead of coloring waveforms
* Do the same thing on Time Series (instead of Spectrograms) using 1D convolutions â†’ Time Series should have more information?
* Do the same thing with Glitches? â†’ Requires figuring out the Omicron stuff?
* Write up
* ???
* Profit ðŸ’¸ðŸ’¸ðŸ’¸
