# gw-continuous
Detect gravitational waves in spectrograms using a Deep Fully Convolutional Net (DFCN), which basically allows arbitrary input sizes.



### To Do List:

* Parameter Estimation: Chirp Mass, Distance
* Do the same thing with Glitches? â†’ Requires figuring out the Omicron stuff?
* Don't only present coincident injections, maybe it helps to sometimes just inject a waveform in one detector, still demanding for zero output.
* What do we gain in terms of evaluation by making these actual triggers and defining a score?
* Write up
* ???
* Profit ðŸ’¸ðŸ’¸ðŸ’¸
