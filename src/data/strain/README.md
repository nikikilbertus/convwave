# Strain

This folder will hold the HDF/H5 files containing the real strain data (from the [LIGO website](https://losc.ligo.org/s/events/GW150914/GW150914_tutorial.html)) that are necessary to calculate the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of the noise, and this README file is necessary so that git keeps the folder in the repository :)
