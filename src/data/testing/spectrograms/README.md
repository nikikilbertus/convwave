# Testing: Spectrograms

This folder will hold the HDF/H5 files containing testing data (i.e. noise plus injected waveforms) that can be used to test the trained network. In particular, this folder will hold testing data in the form of spectrograms. This README file is necessary so that git keeps the folder in the repository :)
