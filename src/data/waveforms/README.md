# Waveforms

This folder will hold the HDF/H5 files containing pre-computed waveforms that can be used for injections. This README file is necessary so that git keeps the folder in the repository :)

The naming convention for the waveform files is `waveforms_<dist1>_<dist2>.h5`, i.e. for example `waveforms_0250_0500.h5` (leading zeros are useful to make sure the files actually get sorted by distance).
