# Predictions: Time Series (Training)

This folder will hold the HDF/H5 files containing the predictions on the test split during training made by the Fully Convolutional Network (i.e. usually `pytorch_train_<input-type>.py`), and this README file is necessary so that git keeps the folder in the repository :)
