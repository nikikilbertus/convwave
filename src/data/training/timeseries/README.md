# Training: Time Series

This folder will hold the HDF/H5 files containing training data (i.e. Gaussian noise plus injected waveforms) that can be used to train the network. In particular, this folder will hold training data in the form of time series. This README file is necessary so that git keeps the folder in the repository :)
