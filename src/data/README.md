This folder is the standard location (i.e. scripts can expect data to be in this folder) for input data (e.g. generated waveforms), and this README file is necessary so that git keeps the folder in the repository :)

*Note:* Data files (especially large ones) should not be checked into GitHub! This folder will remain empty in the repo; only put stuff in here locally!
